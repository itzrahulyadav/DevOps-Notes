# How Envoy Knows Its Role: Configuration, Topology, and Network Layers

This note explains how an Envoy proxy functions as an Ingress, Egress, or Sidecar proxy. It clarifies that Envoy doesn't have "modes" but instead derives its function from its configuration and placement within the cluster. It also details how this application-level proxying interacts with the underlying cloud network infrastructure like NAT Gateways and Route Tables.

## The Core Concept: Envoy Has No "Modes"

The most critical thing to understand is this: **Envoy is just a highly configurable proxy**. It has no built-in "ingress mode," "egress mode," or "sidecar mode."

It's a single piece of software whose function is determined by two things:  
1. **Where you place it**  
2. **What rulebook (configuration) you give it**

---

## Envoy Roles

### As an Ingress Gateway
- You place Envoy at the front gate of the cluster (via a LoadBalancer Service).  
- You give it a configuration that tells it how to route external traffic to internal services.  

### As a Sidecar
- You place Envoy alongside a specific application in the same Pod.  
- You give it a configuration to manage that one application's inbound and outbound traffic, often by listening on localhost.  

### As an Egress Gateway
- You place Envoy at a centralized exit point inside the cluster (via a ClusterIP Service).  
- You give it a configuration with rules for handling traffic destined for outside the cluster.  

---

## In short, the role is decided by:

- **The `envoy.yaml` Configuration File:** This is the rulebook that tells Envoy what to do with the traffic it sees.  
- **The Kubernetes Deployment Topology:** This is the placement that determines whose traffic Envoy sees in the first place.

## Connecting to Cloud Networking (NAT, UDR, Route Tables)

Application-level proxies (**Layer 7**, like Envoy) and cloud networking (**Layer 3/4**, like NAT Gateways) are not mutually exclusive; they work together in sequence.  

Your applications don't talk to the NAT Gateway directly. They talk to Envoy, and then Envoy talks to the underlying network.

## Visualizing the Egress Gateway Flow

Here is the step-by-step path of a request from a client pod to an external service, controlled by an **Egress Gateway**.  

**Scenario:** A client-pod tries to make a request to `https://www.google.com`. The application is configured to use the Envoy Egress Gateway as its proxy.  

### 1. Application-Level Decision (Inside the Pod)
- The application (`curl`) knows it must use a proxy.  
- It does not try to connect to `google.com`. Instead, it opens a connection to the proxy's address:  



### 2. Kubernetes Service Routing (Cluster Network)
- Kubernetes DNS resolves `envoy-egress-gateway` to a stable service IP.  
- `kube-proxy` routes the network packets from the client-pod to the envoy-egress-gateway pod.  

### 3. Envoy's Application Logic (Inside the Egress Pod)
- Envoy receives the request.  
- It inspects the HTTP headers and sees the original destination was `www.google.com`.  
- It checks its rulebook (`envoy.yaml`). The rules say to only allow traffic to `httpbin.org` and block everything else.  
- The request is denied. Envoy generates a `403 Forbidden` response and sends it back to the client-pod. The request never leaves the cluster.  

### 4. The Hand-off to the Cloud Network Layer (For an ALLOWED Request)
- If the request had been to `https://httpbin.org`, Envoy's rules would have allowed it.  
- Envoy would then make a new outbound connection from itself to the public IP of `httpbin.org`.  
- This new connection packet leaves the GKE Node.  
- The packet hits the subnet's **Route Table**.  
- The Route Table directs internet-bound (`0.0.0.0/0`) traffic to the **NAT Gateway**.  
- The NAT Gateway replaces the Node's internal IP with its own public IP and sends the request to the internet.  

⚠️ **Note:** You don't configure Route Tables to point to Envoy. You configure **applications** to point to Envoy. Envoy then becomes the source of legitimate outbound traffic, which is then subjected to the rules of your underlying cloud network.

## How to Configure Applications to Point to Envoy

There are three primary methods for directing application traffic to an Envoy proxy:  

---

### Method 1: Direct Application Configuration (The Explicit Way)
You change the application's configuration to point to the Envoy listener instead of the final destination service. This is common for sidecars.  

**Without Envoy:**
```yaml
env:
- name: BACKEND_API_URL
  value: "http://backend-service:8080"


With Envoy Sidecar: (sid

env:
  - name: BACKEND_API_URL
    value: "http://localhost:9000"


Method 2: Using HTTP Proxy Environment Variables (The Standard Way)

spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-application
    image: my-app:1.0
    env:
    - name: HTTP_PROXY
      value: "http://envoy-egress-gateway:8080"
    - name: HTTPS_PROXY
      value: "http://envoy-egress-gateway:8080"
    - name: NO_PROXY
      # CRITICAL: Prevent proxying for internal cluster communication
      value: "localhost,127.0.0.1,kubernetes.default.svc,.cluster.local"


Method 3: Transparent Traffic Interception via iptables (The "Magic" Way)
This is how service meshes like Istio work. It requires zero application configuration changes.

An initContainer runs before the main application, setting up iptables rules within the pod's network namespace.

These rules invisibly redirect all TCP traffic from the application to the Envoy sidecar's listener port.

Flow:

The application thinks it's connecting directly to http://backend-service:8080.

iptables hijacks the packet and reroutes it to Envoy on localhost:15001.

Envoy inspects the packet to find its original intended destination, applies its rules, and then forwards the traffic correctly.

⚡ Setting this up manually is complex, which is why it is the primary value of an automated service mesh.
