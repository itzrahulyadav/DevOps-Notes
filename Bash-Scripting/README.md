## Bash-Scripting

**A bash shell script is a plain text file containing a set of various commands that we usually type in the command line.It can be used to
automate software development tasks such as code compilation,debugging source code,change management and software testing.**

**Bash-Bourne again shell**

## Getting started

Let's start and create a file named `hello-world.sh` and add this code 

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello world"
```

The first line of the script `#!/bin/bash` is called **shebang**.It tells the operating system which interpreter to use to run the script.
It instructs the operating system to use bin/bash ,the Bash shell,passing it the script's path as an argument.

Example

`/bin/bash hello-world.sh`
